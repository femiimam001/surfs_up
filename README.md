### Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval with Jupyter Notebook, SQLite and SQLAlchemy

## PROJECT OVERVIEW ANALYSIS

This project explores the power of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature data were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

### RESOURCES TOOLS

- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Programming Files: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, climate_analysis.ipynb
- Data Tools: Python SQL toolkit (SQLAlchemy), Object Relational Mapper, pandas, numpy
- Software: SQLlite, Python 3.9.2, Flask, Jupyter Notebook

## PROJECT DELIVERABLES

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)
