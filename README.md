### Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval with Jupyter Notebook, SQLite and SQLAlchemy

## PROJECT OVERVIEW ANALYSIS

This project explores the power of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature data were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

### RESOURCES TOOLS

- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Programming Files: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, climate_analysis.ipynb
- Data Tools: Python SQL toolkit (SQLAlchemy), Object Relational Mapper, pandas, numpy
- Software: SQLlite, Python 3.9.2, Flask, Jupyter Notebook

## PROJECT DELIVERABLES

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

### PREDOMINANT WEATHER DIFFERENCES - OAHU (HAWAII)

1. There was an average of 75 degrees F recorded temperature in June, with a 4 degrees higher disparity as compared to the average in December.
   Hence,this is an indication of 5% change in average temperature from June to December.
2. Also,the frequency of temperature in June has a significant normal curve distribution,in correlation to the smaller standard dev. measure of June against December.
3. The temperature in December shows a considerable higher variability compared to June temperature. Looking at the median temperature in December, we can conclude that its within the average with little or no outliers variability away from the actual frequency recorded.

### SUMMARY

In conclusion,we can say that the temperature recorded in June is less in comparison to December.December temperature provides a favourable precipitation both for surfing and ice cream sales. The 4 degress disparity in June and December average temperatures follows with the highest recorded through the years in 75 and 67 respectively as compared to 72 degress frequency.

Hence, the summary statistics computation has shown that Oahu can construct their prospective shop irrespective of the variances in temperatures and the frequencies recorded.
